Project Description:
The Simple Word Guessing Game is a basic Python program designed to randomly select a word from a predefined list and prompt the user to guess a letter in the selected word. The program provides immediate feedback to the user, indicating whether the guessed letter is in the selected word. The aim of this project is to create a minimalistic game to illustrate fundamental Python concepts such as user input, conditionals, and list manipulation.

Installation Instructions:
Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from Python's official site.
Download the Python script from the repository to a suitable directory on your computer.
Usage Instructions:
Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter or execute the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
sh
Copy code
python filename.py
Note: Replace filename with the actual name of the Python script file.
Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompt to guess a letter in the randomly selected word.
The program will provide immediate feedback regarding the validity of your guess.
File Structure:
filename.py: This is the main Python script file that contains the program logic and controls user interaction. It includes:
A list of available_words containing possible words to be guessed.
The selected_word variable storing the word chosen randomly from the available list.
User input handling and feedback provision based on the guessed letter.
