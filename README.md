Project Description:
The Python Letter Guessing Game is a concise and interactive console application that engages users in a continual process of guessing letters to discern a predefined word. The primary objective of this project is to provide a simplistic and user-friendly game where players can interact and receive immediate feedback on their guesses. This project enabled me to deepen my understanding of Python programming, user input validation, and implementing game loops.

Installation Instructions:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from Python's official site.
Download the script from the repository.
Navigate to the directory containing the script using a terminal or command prompt.
Usage Instructions:
Run the script using a Python interpreter either through an IDE or by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
sh
Copy code
python filename.py
Note: Replace filename with the actual name of your Python script.
Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters in the target word.
To conclude the game, manually stop it using CTRL+C or close the terminal/command prompt.
File Structure:
filename.py: This is the main Python script file where the game functions and logic are implemented. It contains the functions:
is_letter_in_word(): Validates whether the guessed letter is in the target word.
get_validated_user_input(): Obtains and validates user input.
play_guessing_game(): Orchestrates the game loop and handles user interactions.
