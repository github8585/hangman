### **Python-Based Hangman Console Game Project Synopsis**

This repository is dedicated to a Python rendition of the classic Hangman game. It features a console-based interface where players guess hidden words letter by letter, with a limited number of incorrect guesses permitted.

**Instructions for Engagement:**
When the game starts, it randomly selects a word from a set list. Players will guess letters in sequence. If the guess is correct, the letter's positions in the word are revealed. If incorrect, the player loses one life. The game is won by guessing the word within the number of lives given; otherwise, it results in a loss.

**Architectural Overview:**
At the heart of the game is a Python class called `Hangman`, which maintains the game's state and contains methods to check guesses and show the current state of the game. The game begins with the `play_game` function, which creates an instance of the game and controls the flow. Key methods include `check_guess`, `ask_for_input`, `is_game_over`, `has_won`, and `display_game_state`.

**Execution Procedure:**
To play the game, run the Python script in a terminal or command line with `python3 scriptname.py`, replacing `scriptname` with the actual script filename.

**Vocabulary Catalog:**
The game's word list currently includes 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry', but it's designed to be easily expandable to include any desired set of words.

We invite contributions to improve this project. For significant changes, please open an issue to discuss your ideas before making a pull request.
